# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to identify key factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

The analysis focuses on demographic, socio-economic, and family-related attributes using Python-based data analysis techniques.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger information such as:
- Age
- Gender
- Passenger Class
- Fare
- Family relationships
- Survival status

---

## Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering
- Handled missing values in the Age column using statistical imputation
- Verified data quality by checking null values and duplicates
- Created a new feature **FamilySize** to analyze the impact of traveling alone vs with family

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The analysis explored survival patterns across:
- Gender
- Passenger class
- Age distribution
- Fare levels
- Family size

---

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males
- First-class passengers had better survival chances
- Passengers with smaller family sizes were more likely to survive

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization using Python.
