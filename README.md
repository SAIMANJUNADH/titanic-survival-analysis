# Titanic Survival Analysis 🚢

## Motivation & Problem Statement
The Titanic disaster dataset is widely used for learning data analysis and predictive modeling.  
This project aims to demonstrate how a data analyst approaches a real-world dataset: cleaning data, exploring patterns, and extracting meaningful insights.

**Target Audience**
- Aspiring data analysts and data science learners  
- Recruiters evaluating analytical and exploratory data analysis skills  

**Decision Context**
The analysis explores how demographic and socio-economic factors influenced survival outcomes, similar to how analysts evaluate risk, fairness, and decision outcomes in real-world datasets.

## Project Overview
This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic passenger dataset to identify key factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger-level information including:
- Demographics (age, gender)
- Passenger class
- Fare paid
- Family relationships
- Survival outcome

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Key Insights
- Female passengers had significantly higher survival rates than males  
- First-class passengers had better survival chances  
- Passengers with smaller family sizes were more likely to survive
